### Optional workshop extensions

*Extend your learning by completing either or both of our optional workshop modules.*

First, we will implement native Step Functions service integrations with Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send automated e-mail alerts in the event of any errors.

Second, we will update our state machine to allow dynamic parallel processing many images in a single request to better enable our workflow to scale up our processing.

You may complete either or both of these modules in any order you desire as both are optional.
