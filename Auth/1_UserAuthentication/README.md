# Module 1: User Authentication

In this module, you will create an Amazon Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool for the wild rydes application.
The Cognito User Pool will store user profile information and provide sign-up and sign-in capabilities, with the Cognito Identity Pool providing the ability to assume an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role from within the application.

Since Wild Rydes is a ride sharing application, a key requirement is that all users must sign-up and sign-in before they're allowed to request a ride. You will configure the application to integrate with [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for these purposes via the [AWS Amplify JavaScript library](https://aws-amplify.github.io/).

## Solution Architecture

The architecture for this module is very straightforward. All of your static web content including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and other files will be served locally from your Cloud9 workspace. As you made changes to the website application code, all changes will be automatically updated and shown in your browser via live reload capabilities.

For this module, we will be creating a Cognito User Pool as our secure user directory then configuring our application to use the AWS Amplify library to easily integrate Amazon Cognito into our application.

## Implementation Overview

Each of the following sections provides an implementation overview and detailed, step-by-step instructions. The overview should provide enough context for you to complete the implementation if you're already familiar with the AWS Management Console or you want to explore the services yourself without following a walkthrough.

If you're using the latest version of the Chrome, Firefox, or Safari web browsers the step-by-step instructions won't be visible until you expand the section.

### 1. Running the website locally

1. From your Cloud9 workspace, select the terminal window and when you are within your website directory, run the following command to start the local web server 

    ```console
    yarn start
    ```

    Wait for the development server to start. You can ignore any message saying *Compiled with warnings* as we will resolve these warnings as we add our functionality to the application.


2. Now that the development server has started, click **Preview** in the top of the screen next to the Run button.

    ![Cloud9 Preview](../images/cloud9-local-preview.png)  

3. The web application will load in a small window next to the terminal at the bottom of the Cloud9 IDE. Click the **re-size button** next to the word **Browser** to open this window in a new tab.

    ![Cloud9 Preview Re-size](../images/cloud9-resize-live-preview.png)   

   As you make changes to the web application, this tab will automatically refresh to reflect your changes. Leave this tab open and return to the Cloud9 IDE tab to continue the workshop.

   Though the Wild Rydes website may look function, there is currently no integration for sign-up or sign-in requests to go anywhere.

### 2. Creating a Cognito User Pool

Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. In this step, we'll create a Cognito user pool for use with our Wild Rydes app.

#### High-Level Instructions

Use the AWS console to create an Amazon Cognito User Pool adding a custom attribute named `profile_picture` and requiring multi-factor authentication via SMS message.

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-step instructions (expand for details)</strong></summary><p>

1. In the AWS Management Console choose **Services** then select **Cognito** under Security, Identity, and Compliance.

1. Choose your desired **Region** in top-right of the console if not already chosen.

1. Choose **Manage User Pools**.

1. Choose **Create a User Pool** in the top right of the console.

1. Provide a name for your user pool such as `wild-rydes`.

1. Choose **Step through settings** to configure our user pool options.

![User Pool Setup Step 1](../images/cognito-userpool-setup-step1.png)

1. Leave **Username** checked, but additionally select *Also allow sign in with verified email address* and *Also allow sign in with verified phone number*.

1. At the bottom of the screen, choose **Add custom attribute** and add a string attribute named `profile_picture`. Leave the attribute set as mutable with a max length of 256 characters.

![User Pool Setup Step 2](../images/cognito-userpool-setup-step2.png)

1. Choose **Next**.

1. Leave password policies and user sign up settings set to default settings and choose **Next**.

![User Pool Setup Step 3](../images/cognito-userpool-setup-step3.png)

1. Choose to set MFA as **Required** as we want to enforce additional security in our application.

1. Choose to enable SMS text message as the second factor authentication option.

1. Choose to require validation of email and phone numbers both.

![User Pool Setup Step 4](../images/cognito-userpool-setup-step4.png)

1. Choose **Create role** to create an IAM role with the default name to allow Cognito to send SMS messages on your behalf.

1. Choose **Next step**.

1. Leave all message defaults as-is and choose **Next step**.

1. Skip adding any tags and click **Next step**.

1. Choose **No** to not remember your user's devices then click **Next step**.

![User Pool Setup Step 5](../images/cognito-userpool-setup-step5.png)

1. Choose **Add an app client**

1. Input `wild-rydes-web-app` as the app client name

1. Uncheck **Generate client secret**. Client secrets are used for server-side applications authentication and are not needed for JavaScript applications.

![User Pool Setup Step 6](../images/cognito-userpool-setup-step6.png)

1. Choose **Next step**.

1. Leavea all Lambda trigger settings set to **none**. These trigger settings allow you to extend the out-of-the-box sign-up and sign-in flows with your own custom logic, but we will not be using this feature in this workshop.

1. Choose **Next step**.

1. Review summary of all provided settings for accuracy then choose **Create pool**.

1. Create a new editor tab within Cloud9 and copy/paste your new User pool's Pool Id and Pool ARN to the scratchpad tab. You will be using these values later on.

1. Click **App clients** in the left-hand nav menu under *General Settings*

1. Copy/paste your app client's ID to the scratchpad editor tab within Cloud9 for later reference.

### 3. Creating a Cognito Identity Pool

Cognito Identity Pools are used to provide AWS credentials via IAM roles to end-user applications. Since we'll be using IAM integration to integrate our Cognito deployment and users with other AWS services, we'll go ahead and create this identity pool now.

#### High-Level Instructions

You will need to create a Cognito Identity Pool linked to the Cognito User Pool and app client ID you just created. Your application will not require un-authenticated users to access any AWS resources, so you do not need to enable access to unauthenticated identities. 

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-step instructions (expand for details)</strong></summary><p>

1. In the Cognito console, choose **Federated Identities** in the header bar to switch to the console for Cognito Federated Identities.

1. Choose **Create new Identity pool**.

1. Input `wildrydes_identity_pool` as the Identity pool name.

1. Under Authentication providers, within the Cognito tab, input the User Pool ID and App client Id you copied previously to the scratchpad.

![Identity Pool Setup Step 1](../images/cognito-identitypool-setup-step1.png)

1. Choose **Create Pool**.

1. Choose **Allow** to allow Cognito Identity Pools to setup IAM roles for your application's users. Permissions and settings of these roles can be customized later.

1. Copy/paste the **Identity Pool ID** from the code sample within the Get AWS Credentials section into your Cloud9 scatchpad editor tab.

### 4. Integrating your application with Amazon Cognito using AWS Amplify

Now that you've created and configured your Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool, you need to configure your application to integrate to Amazon Cognito so it can store user profiles and enable sign-up and sign-in.

#### High-Level Instructions

You will import the AWS Amplify library into the project then add sign-up and sign-in utility classes to integrate with our existing UI and front-end components.

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-step instructions (expand for details)</strong></summary><p>

1. Before using any AWS Amplify modules, we first need to configure Amplify to use our newly created Cognito resources by updating `/website/src/amplify-config.js`.

1. After opening this file in your Cloud9 IDE editor, find an replace the following parameters with values from your previous scratchpad:
- `identityPoolId`
- `region`
- `userPoolId`
- `userPoolWebClientId`

1. Before using any AWS Amplify modules, we first need to configure Amplify to use our AWS environment configuration stored in `/website/src/amplify-config.js`.

    Edit the `src/index.js` file to add the following lines to the top of the file (below all the other imports) to configure Amplify then save your changes:

    ```
    import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
    import awsConfig from './amplify-config';

    Amplify.configure(awsConfig);
    ```

1. Now that we've imported the Amplify and configured the Amplify library, we need to update our application's code to sign-up users using Amplify and Cognito User Pools by finding and replacing the following methods within the `/website/src/auth/SignUp.js` file with the code below then save your changes.

    ```
    async onSubmitForm(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        try {
        const params = {
            username: this.state.email.replace(/[@.]/g, '|'),
            password: this.state.password,
            attributes: {
            email: this.state.email,
            phone_number: this.state.phone
            },
            validationData: []
        };
        const data = await Auth.signUp(params);
        console.log(data);
        this.setState({ stage: 1 });
        } catch (err) {
        alert(err.message);
        console.error("Exception from Auth.signUp: ", err);
        this.setState({ stage: 0, email: '', password: '', confirm: '' });
        }
    }

    async onSubmitVerification(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        try {
        const data = await Auth.confirmSignUp(
            this.state.email.replace(/[@.]/g, '|'),
            this.state.code
        );
        console.log(data);
        // Go to the sign in page
        this.props.history.replace('/signin');
        } catch (err) {
        alert(err.message);
        console.error("Exception from Auth.confirmSignUp: ", err);
        this.setState({ stage: 0, email: '', password: '', confirm: '', code: '' });
        }
    }
    ```

1. You additionally need to integrate the sign-in capability to use AWS Amplify and Cognito by finding and replacing the following methods within the `/website/src/auth/SignIn.js` file with the code below then save your changes.

    ```
    async onSubmitForm(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        try {
            const userObject = await Auth.signIn(
                this.state.email.replace(/[@.]/g, '|'),
                this.state.password
            );
            // console.log('Cognito User Object:', userObject);
            this.setState({ userObject, stage: 1 });
        } catch (err) {
            alert(err.message);
            console.error('Auth.signIn(): ', err);
        }
    }

    async onSubmitVerification(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        try {
            const data = await Auth.confirmSignIn(
                this.state.userObject,
                this.state.code
            );
            console.log('Cognito User Data:', data);
            const session = await Auth.currentSession();
            // console.log('Cognito User Access Token:', session.getAccessToken().getJwtToken());
            console.log('Cognito User Identity Token:', session.getIdToken().getJwtToken());
            // console.log('Cognito User Refresh Token', session.getRefreshToken().getToken());
            this.setState({ stage: 0, email: '', password: '', code: '' });
            this.props.history.replace('/app');
        } catch (err) {
            alert(err.message);
            console.error('Auth.confirmSignIn(): ', err);
        }
    }
    ```

1. Finally, we need to ensure our application evaluates the user's authenticated state. You will need to make a final edit to the route configuration in `/website/src/index.js` so that the current authentication is read from local storage, then adjust the routing based on authentication.

    Open `/website/src/index.js` in your Cloud9 IDE and find and replace the following code to evaluate whether a user is authenticated via Amplify.

    ```
    const isAuthenticated = () => Amplify.Auth.user !== null;
    ```

</p></details>

### 5. Validate sign-up and sign-in are now working with Amazon Cognito

Now that you have integrated our Amplify code into our application, you need to test the site to see that authentication is working end-to-end.

#### High-Level Instructions

Return to your browser tab where you started your Wild Rydes application earlier after popping out from the Cloud9 IDE once in preview mode. This page automatically refreshes after you save any code changes so should now reflect all of your changes and be ready for testing.

Sign-up as a new user then sign-in with that user. Provide a valid phone number with `+country_code` first preceeding the number. For a US-based phone number, an example would be `+14251234567`. You should then see that a SMS message is sent with a one-time code upon login.

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-step instructions (expand for details)</strong></summary><p>

1. Visit `/register` path of your Cloud9's website to go to the registration page.

1. Input your e-mail address, phone number with `+country_code` first preceeding the number, as well as your password twice. For a US-based phone number, an example would be `+14251234567`.

1. Choose **Let's Ryde** to submit registration.

1. On the verify e-mail screen, enter the SMS one-time code sent to your phone number provided then choose **Verify**.

1. Assuming no errors were encountered, you will be redirected to the Sign-in screen. Now, re-enter the same e-mail address and password you chose at registration.

1. When prompted for an MFA code, check your phone entered previously for an SMS message. Enter your **SMS MFA code** at the verification code prompt then choose **Verify**.

1. If the page then loads a map, sign-in was successful and you have successfully integrated Cognito for app authentication.
