# Getting Started: Workshop Prerequisites and Setup

This section outlines the prerequisites to complete the workshop and instructions for launching a Cloud9 IDE environment that you will use throughout the workshop.

## Prerequisites

### AWS Account

In order to complete this workshop, you'll need an AWS account and access to
create and manage the AWS services that are used in this workshop, including Cloud9, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one participant is using a given AWS account at a time. If you attempt sharing an account with another participant, you will encounter naming conflicts for certain resources. You can work around this by using distinct Regions, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes required to make this work.

Please make sure not to use a production AWS environment/account for this workshop. It is recommended to instead use a development account which provides full access to the necessary services so that you do not run into permissions issues.

### Region Selection

Use a single region for the entirety of this workshop. This workshop supports three regions in North America, three regions in Europe, and three in Asia Pacific. Choose one region from the launch stack links below and continue to use that region for all of the Auth workshop activities.

### AWS Cloud9 IDE

[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets
you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code
editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools
for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
pre-installed so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for
this workshop. 

In this workshop, you will use a Cloud9 environment which will have access to the same AWS resources as the user with which you logged into the AWS Management Console.

## Cloud9 IDE Setup

In this section you will launch a CloudFormation stack that will create a a new [Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) environment and a [Cloud9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) Instance that you will use in the rest of the workshop.

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-step instructions (expand for details)</strong></summary><p>

1. Launch the CloudFormation stack from the links above, choosing the link appropriate for the region you selected for this workshop.

1. On the next screen, Step 2, confirm the stack name is  `WildRydes-Cloud9` and click **Next**.

1. On the Configure Stack Options page, accept all the defaults and click **Next**.

1. Choose to **Acknowledge that the CloudFormation template may create IAM resources with custom names**. Finally, click **Create stack**.

1. It will take a few minutes for the Stack to create. Wait until the stack is fully launched and shows a Status of **CREATE_COMPLETE**.

1. With the `WildRydes-Cloud9` stack selected, click on the **Outputs** tab and copy the value shown for the `Cloud9IDE` to the clipboard. Open that URL in a new browswer tab to load your IDE environment.

</p></details>

Once you have launched and navigated to your Cloud9 workspace URL shown in your CloudFormation stack outputs, you should have an IDE environment as shown below:

![Cloud9 Initial Welcome Screen](../images/cloud9_initial_screen.png)

You can run AWS CLI commands in here just like you would on your local computer. Verify that your user is logged in by running `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You'll see output indicating your account and user information:

```
Admin:~/environment $ aws sts get-caller-identity
```
```
{
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "UserId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
}
```

Keep your AWS Cloud9 IDE opened in a tab throughout this workshop as you'll be using it for most all activities.

### Download Workshop Code

1. Switch to the tab where you have your Cloud9 environment opened.

1. Clone the workshop repository to your IDE environmen by running the following command in the Cloud9 terminal window:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/justonian/aws-serverless-workshops.git
    ```

### Initialize your developer workspace

1. Run the following commands to upgrade your Node.js version to v10

    ```console
    nvm i 10
    nvm alias default 10
    ```

2. Install the yarn package manager and website dependencies by running the following commands

    ```console
    npm install -g yarn
    cd aws-serverless-workshops/Auth/website
    yarn install
    ```

### Tips

:bulb: Keep an open scratch pad in Cloud9 or a text editor on your local computer
for notes.  When the step-by-step directions tell you to note something such as
an ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN), copy and paste that into the scratch pad.

### Recap

* Use a unique personal or development AWS Account
* Use a single, consistent region throughout all modules of this Auth workshop
* Keep your [AWS Cloud9 IDE](#aws-cloud9-ide) opened in a tab at all times

### Next

Once you have your Cloud9 workspace fully working, proceed to the first module, [User Authentication](../1_UserAuthentication).
