# Wild Rydes Serverless Workshops

This repository contains a collection of workshops and other hands on content that will guide you through building various serverless applications using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis and other services.

# Workshops

- [**Web Application**](WebApplication) - This workshop shows you how to build a dynamic web application without servers. You'll learn how to host static web resources with Amazon S3, how to use Amazon Cognito to manage users and authentication, and how to build a RESTful API for backend processing using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB.

- [**Data Processing**](DataProcessing) - This workshop demonstrates how to collect, store, and process data without managing servers. In this workshop you'll learn how to automatically process files on Amazon S3 using AWS Lambda, how to build real-time streaming applications using Amazon Kinesis Streams and Amazon Kinesis Analytics, how to archive data streams using Amazon Kinesis Firehose and Amazon S3, and how to run ad-hoc queries on those files using Amazon Athena.

- [**DevOps**](DevOps) - This workshop shows you how to use the [Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) to build a RESTful API without servers, using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB.  You'll learn how to use SAM from your workstation to release updates to your API, how to build a serverless CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, and how to enhance your pipeline to manage multiple environments for your API.

- [**Image Processing**](ImageProcessing) - This module shows you how to build an image processing workflow without servers. You'll learn the basics of serverless orchestration using AWS Step Functions while leveraging the deep learning-based facial recognition features of Amazon Rekogntion.
